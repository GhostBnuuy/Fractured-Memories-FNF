Lullaby GF: Sticky enjoyed the general design of her and the mod when it first came out
Whitty: One of the first original mods, and one Sticky enjoyed as well.
Ruria: Sticky really enjoyed the mod and the character for Ruria, and especially when he got that dm with audio from the VA herself.
Sarv: Sticky used to use sprites of her on stream before his pngtuber was created, this was a call back to that.
Garcello: Was a call back to the but bad Garcello, and includes his cough
Spyro: Spyro replaced a Redacted character due to the goof still fitting the same criteria. They are the original creater of Staker and a few other variants for the Sticks
Shaggy: A call back to the Shaggy Expurgation Cover including the remastered stage from it.
