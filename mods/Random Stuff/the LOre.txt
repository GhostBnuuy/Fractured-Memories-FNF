Sticknophanes is an .exe variant of Sticky in an alternative universe to our own. In that Universe Sticknophanes  took on the form of Sticky, seeing him as someone important in the FNF community and to other worldly people. To lure Sticky in, he used BF as a way to invite Sticky to a rap battle.. Along  arriving there, Sticky knew something was immediately off. On the ground sat BF's Hat, which seemed to be covered in blood. Sticky felt a strange presence behind him a ghostly mist version of himself with a cold stare black and a glowing green eye. They rapped instead of BF, but unfortunately for Sticky...he got possessed by Stick, his appearance altering to fit Stick's. Due to this, Stick lure in those close to Sticky, and well his fans. Offering them an opportunity to stream or play  a game with them.. Instead they were lured into a trap with nowhere to run. Eventually Sticknophanes grew more powerful each day, each soul taken, each drop of blood spilled, he grew to an all powerful being. A near well.. God. There were rarely any survivors left, some remained hidden some went off world. The world we knew ruined.
