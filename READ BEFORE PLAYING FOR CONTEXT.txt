Hello and thanks for downloading Fractured Memories! This mod is a blast in the past for Sticky's Streams but in a slightly different way. I am sure by now you all know that Sticky has Variants of himself like Fleetway, Staker, etc. Well this here is my special take on a variant for Sticky, known as Sticknophanes.

If the name isn't obvious on which mod character it is based off of I will just say it's Xenophanes from the VS. Sonic.exe mod. The lore for said variant will be in the mod files somewhere. Find it if you are so curious or keep it shrouded more in mystery :o 

If you ever play this Sticky I wanted to let you know that your streams bring many of us joy and I wanted to repay that by making this with the others.
I wanna also thank Spyro for creating the original thumbnail art you brought this to life more.
Alex I also want to thank you for going out of your way and making this mod as amazing as possible as well. I owe ya one.


Please enjoy!
